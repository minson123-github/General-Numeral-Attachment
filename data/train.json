This business had another strong year growing its top line 6% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several key brands including Ibrance Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018 Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion which represented an increase of 32% operationally. While approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are getting a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance leadership in the class based on the strength of our data significant first-mover advantage and most importantly the continued positive patient experience with more than 200000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S. particularly in developed Europe and Japan and we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi and our launch of the expanded indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. following the July approval made the first and only FDA-approved oral medication for both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year and we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December along with our alliance partner Astellas we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi and we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our Oncology portfolio for years to come. But this year Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019 particularly in ulcerative colitis. Eliquis had another strong year with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year with revenues totaling $3.6 billion.

This business had another strong year growing its top line 6% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several key brands including Ibrance Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018 Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion which represented an increase of 32% operationally. While approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are getting a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance leadership in the class based on the strength of our data significant first-mover advantage and most importantly the continued positive patient experience with more than 200000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S. particularly in developed Europe and Japan and we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi and our launch of the expanded indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. following the July approval made the first and only FDA-approved oral medication for both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year and we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December along with our alliance partner Astellas we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi and we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our Oncology portfolio for years to come. But this year Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019 particularly in ulcerative colitis. Eliquis had another strong year with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year with revenues totaling $3.6 billion.

This business had another strong year growing its top line 6% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several key brands including Ibrance Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018 Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion which represented an increase of 32% operationally. While approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are getting a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance leadership in the class based on the strength of our data significant first-mover advantage and most importantly the continued positive patient experience with more than 200000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S. particularly in developed Europe and Japan and we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi and our launch of the expanded indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. following the July approval made the first and only FDA-approved oral medication for both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year and we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December along with our alliance partner Astellas we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi and we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our Oncology portfolio for years to come. But this year Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019 particularly in ulcerative colitis. Eliquis had another strong year with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year with revenues totaling $3.6 billion.

This business had another strong year growing its top line 6% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several key brands including Ibrance Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018 Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion which represented an increase of 32% operationally. While approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are getting a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance leadership in the class based on the strength of our data significant first-mover advantage and most importantly the continued positive patient experience with more than 200000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S. particularly in developed Europe and Japan and we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi and our launch of the expanded indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. following the July approval made the first and only FDA-approved oral medication for both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year and we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December along with our alliance partner Astellas we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi and we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our Oncology portfolio for years to come. But this year Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion.

This business had another strong year growing its top line 6% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several key brands including Ibrance Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018 Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion which represented an increase of 32% operationally. While approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are getting a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance leadership in the class based on the strength of our data significant first-mover advantage and most importantly the continued positive patient experience with more than 200000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S. particularly in developed Europe and Japan and we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi and our launch of the expanded indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. following the July approval made the first and only FDA-approved oral medication for both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year and we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December along with our alliance partner Astellas we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi and we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our Oncology portfolio for years to come. But this year Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019 particularly in ulcerative colitis. Eliquis had another strong year with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year with revenues totaling $3.6 billion.

This business had another strong year growing its top line 6% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several key brands including Ibrance Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018 Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion which represented an increase of 32% operationally. While approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are getting a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance leadership in the class based on the strength of our data significant first-mover advantage and most importantly the continued positive patient experience with more than 200000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S. particularly in developed Europe and Japan and we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi and our launch of the expanded indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. following the July approval made the first and only FDA-approved oral medication for both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year and we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December along with our alliance partner Astellas we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi and we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our Oncology portfolio for years to come. But this year Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019 particularly in ulcerative colitis. Eliquis had another strong year with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year with revenues totaling $3.6 billion.

This business had another strong year growing its top line 6% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several key brands including Ibrance Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018 Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion which represented an increase of 32% operationally. While approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are getting a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance leadership in the class based on the strength of our data significant first-mover advantage and most importantly the continued positive patient experience with more than 200000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S. particularly in developed Europe and Japan and we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi and our launch of the expanded indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. following the July approval made the first and only FDA-approved oral medication for both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year and we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December along with our alliance partner Astellas we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi and we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our Oncology portfolio for years to come. But this year Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019 particularly in ulcerative colitis. Eliquis had another strong year with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year with revenues totaling $3.6 billion.

This business had another strong year growing its top line 6% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several key brands including Ibrance Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018 Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion which represented an increase of 32% operationally. While approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are getting a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance leadership in the class based on the strength of our data significant first-mover advantage and most importantly the continued positive patient experience with more than 200000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S. particularly in developed Europe and Japan and we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi and our launch of the expanded indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. following the July approval made the first and only FDA-approved oral medication for both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year and we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December along with our alliance partner Astellas we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi and we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our Oncology portfolio for years to come. But this year Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019 particularly in ulcerative colitis. Eliquis had another strong year with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year with revenues totaling $3.6 billion.

For the quarter enterprise solutions revenue decreased 3.0% partner solutions revenue decreased 9.2% and business markets revenue is down 5.6%. Overall secular and pricing pressures continue to be significant headwinds for these businesses. We expect legacy product revenues to continue to decline in 2019 at rates consistent with last year. In order to counter this decline we continue to invest in fiber-based products and new applications that will open new opportunities for customers across our business lines. Through our One Fiber initiative we are building a single highly resilient and scalable fiber network that will allow us to efficiently provide advanced data services to customers across our consumer business and enterprise customer groups. As a result we remain confident that we can continue to generate growth and momentum in fiber-based products and new applications.

This business had another strong year growing its top line 6% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several key brands including Ibrance Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets. I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018 Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion which represented an increase of 32% operationally. While approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are getting a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance leadership in the class based on the strength of our data significant first-mover advantage and most importantly the continued positive patient experience with more than 200000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S. particularly in developed Europe and Japan and we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi and our launch of the expanded indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. following the July approval made the first and only FDA-approved oral medication for both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year and we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December along with our alliance partner Astellas we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone. These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi and we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our Oncology portfolio for years to come. But this year Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019 particularly in ulcerative colitis. Eliquis had another strong year with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year with revenues totaling $3.6 billion. In December we entered into a definitive agreement with GSK under which we have agreed to create a new Consumer Healthcare joint venture.
